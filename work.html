    <h1> Winter </h1>
    <p id="u12"> Winter is the coldest and darkest season of the year in polar and temperate climates. It occurs after autumn and before spring. The tilt of Earth's axis causes seasons; winter occurs when a hemisphere is oriented away from the Sun.</p> 
    <p id="u13">The winter season brings a variety of adverse weather extremes. You may experience heavy snow, ice accumulation, freezing temperatures and wind chill. Winter storms are often called the "deceptive killers". <br>
