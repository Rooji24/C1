    Pollution is the introduction of harmful material in any service area
    such as air, water and land.It occurs mostly due 
    human carelessness. People often put their waste material in trashi.e plastic bottles,wrappers and even burning things could 
    lead to pollution. <br>

    Air pollution is basically cause by releasing toxic substances in the environment.  
    Smoke generated by factories is also let out in the air.The burning of fossil fuel like coal 
    can lead to harmeful smoke.The high level of smoke causes respiratory and cardic problems, and
    effect other parts of the body leading to serious medical conditions.<br>

    When people put their waste items in a trash can without recycling 
    what happens is that mostly this trash reaches to the sea side like the beaches 
    where it is dumped. The critcal problem begins when the plastic and other waste 
    start to trap the animals like turtle and other marine animals.
    This make the marine animal unable to move, which could lead them to becoming exist 
    forver.<br>

    Often the left over trash is dumped on the land slides where thousands of weighted trash 
    is complied. Hundreds of trucks travel to the landfill dumping the trash. As the waste is being 
    decomposed it can release toxins and create leachate that pollute the land 
    ,ground and water.This leads to threatening the public health.
